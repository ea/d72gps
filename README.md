# Kenwood TH D72 GPS Reader


D72 is an oldie but a goodie dualband radio that has a handy GPS logger which a bunch of nice features. 

The only way to get the data off of the radio was to use a rather old and clunky Windows piece of software which was outright confusing, so I wrote a simple python scripts that does it. It reads all the stored GPS logs and compiles it into tracks in a GPX file which can be read by other mapping software, like GPSBabel. 

I _think_ I got all the fields right, but I'd like to know if it gives wrong results in your hemisphere.
